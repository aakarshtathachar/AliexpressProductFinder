# AliexpressProductFinder
Looks at a chosen number of products in a chosen catogory and finds products with a good price, star rating and number of sales. This code also sees if it has sold successfully on Ebay. Can be used for finding products to dropship.
To run this program, use the DropS.py file and input the catogories you want to find products for. Separate multiple catagories with a comma ex. dog toys, cooking pan, cream
While the program is running, it takes a while and prints large amounts of information. You can ignore all of this until the end when the program prints a list of produact names and id numbers
